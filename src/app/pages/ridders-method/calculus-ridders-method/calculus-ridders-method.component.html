        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridders%27_method" target="_blank">Ridders' method</a> 
        is a root-finding algorithm based on 
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi">false position method</a> and 
        the use of an exponential function to successively approximate a root of a continuous function 
        <span class="code">f(x)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given two values of the independent variable, <span class="code">x0</span> and 
        <span class="code">x2</span>, which are on two different sides of the root being sough,
        i.e  <span class="code">f(x0)·f(x2)< 0</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The method begins by evaluating the function at the midpoint:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        <p>{{'$$x_1 = 0.5 \\cdot (x_0 + x_2) $$'}}</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regula_falsi">The false position method</a> is then applied to the points <span class="code">x0</span>
        and <span class="code">x2</span> to computing a new value <span class="code">x3</span>:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        <p>
            <span id="mathContent" [innerHTML]="content"></span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        which then is used as one of the two bracketing values in the next step of the iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we have following three different cases:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If <span class="code">f(x3)=0</span> then the root is <span class="code">x3</span>.</li>
        <li>
            If <span class="code">f(x1)·f(x3)<0</span> then root lies between <span class="code">x1</span> and <span class="code">x3</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If <span class="code">f(x1)·f(x3)>0</span> then the next bracketing value 
            is whichever of <span class="code">x0</span> and <span class="code">x2</span>
            is closer to <span class="code">x3</span> and provides the proper bracket.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So that after each iteration we redefine bracketing values and 
        repeat the calculation process until we find the root within desired accuracy.
