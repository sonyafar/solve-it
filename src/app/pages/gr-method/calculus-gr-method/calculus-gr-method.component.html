        <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/commercial-math/golden-ratio/" target="_blank">Golden-section Search</a> is a variation of
        <a [routerLink]="['/bisection-method']" target="_blank">Bisection method</a> and starts with two initial guesses 
        say <span class="code">x0</span> and <span class="code">x1</span> such that 
        <span class="code">x0</span> and <span class="code">x1</span> brackets the root i.e. 
        <span class="code">f(x0)·f(x1)< 0</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike the Bisection method, the interval is not divided in half, but by the value 
        <span class="code">N≈1.618</span>. 
        If <span class="code">x0</span> and <span class="code">x1</span> 
        are two guesses then we compute a new approximated value as: 
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        <p>
            {{'$$x_2 = x_0 + \\frac{x_1 - x_0}{1.618}$$'}}
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        which then is used as one of the two bracketing values in the next step of the iteration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we have following three different cases:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>If <span class="code">f(x2)=0</span> then the root is <span class="code">x2</span>.</li>
        <li>If <span class="code">f(x0)·f(x2)<0</span> then root lies between <span class="code">x0</span> and <span class="code">x2</span>.</li>
        <li>If <span class="code">f(x0)·f(x2)>0</span> then root lies between <span class="code">x1</span> and <span class="code">x2</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So that after each iteration we redefine bracketing values and 
        repeat the calculation process until we find the root within desired accuracy.
